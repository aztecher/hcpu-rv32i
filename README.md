# hcpu-rv32i

hcpu-rv32i is a RISC-V RV32I compliant software CPU implementation using [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) + [Clash](https://clash-lang.org/)


## Supported/Unsupported Instruction Sets

hcpu-rv32 now support some basic instruction sets of RV32I.  
However, some instruction sets, s.t. FENCE, FENCEI, ... are not implemented yet.

* [x] Consider relation between `Vec n Instruction` and address space
* [ ] Create fibonacci function and check it's execution
* [ ] Check working on compiled Verilog-HDL
* [ ] Check working on FPGA

## Usage

Now, you have to hardcode instruction that you want to execute.  
Please check some example in [src/RV32I/Programs/Example.hs](./src/RV32I/Programs/Example.hs) and test codes.

For example, If you want to run `addImm` program in [Example.hs](./src/RV32I/Programs/Example.hs), you can execute it by GHCi like bellow.  

```bash
Î» > Prelude.take 10 $ sample (cpu initCPUState (programmedRAM addImm) :: Signal System Registers)
...
```

[`sample`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/clash-prelude-0.99.3/docs/Clash-Signal-Internal.html#v:sample) function generates infinit list of result of CPU execution, and `addImm` code will loop by jumping same addresss, so you take some length from this.
